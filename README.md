# Classification-Models
Build and evaluate various machine learning classification models using Python.

# 1. Logistic Regression Classification

Logistic regression is a popular method to predict a categorical response. It is a special case of Generalized Linear models that predicts the probability of the outcomes. 

# 2. Decision Tree Classification

Decision trees are a popular family of classification and regression methods. 

# 3. Random Forest Classification

Random forests are a popular family of classification and regression methods.

# 4. K-nearest neighbour Classification

# 5. SVM Classification

# 6. Kernel SVM classification

# 7. Naive Bayes Classification

# Model evaluation

### Classification accuracy

### Confusion matrix

type-I error occurs when null hypothesis is rejected which should not be in actual. And type-II error occurs when although alternate hypothesis is true, you are failing to reject null hypothesis.

### Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve
Measuring the area under the ROC curve is also a very useful method for evaluating a model. ROC is the ratio of True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR)
